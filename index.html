          Credit cards are one of the most powerful tools for improving a credit profile — but also one of the fastest ways to hurt it. This page explains which habits matter most and how issuers view “improvement”.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What “Improving Your Credit” Actually Means</h2>
      <p>
        When people talk about “improving their credit”, they usually mean moving into a lower-risk category
        in common credit-scoring models. With cards, that mostly comes down to predictable factors: on-time
        payments, utilization levels, account age and the absence of fresh problems like missed payments or collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        No single card guarantees improvement. Instead, issuers and scoring models look at <strong>patterns of use</strong>
        over time: how you borrow, how you pay back, and whether your balances are climbing or stabilising.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Key habits -->
    <section id="habits" class="section">
      <h2>Core Habits That Support Credit Improvement</h2>
      <p>
        Most mainstream scoring systems reward boring consistency rather than tricks. The fundamentals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-time payments:</strong> never missing minimum payments is the single most important variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Low utilization:</strong> keeping total card balances well below limits (often under 30%, ideally lower).</li>
        <li><strong>Stable usage:</strong> regular card activity with full or high repayments, not long periods of inactivity followed by spikes.</li>
        <li><strong>Few hard inquiries:</strong> spacing out applications instead of applying for many products at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Letting accounts age:</strong> keeping well-managed cards open so average account age increases over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These habits are slow-burn, but they are exactly the behaviours models are designed to reward.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Card types & strategy -->
    <section id="products" class="section">
      <h2>Card Types That Can Help Rebuild or Improve</h2>
      <p>
        The type of card you use also matters. Some products are designed for strong profiles, others for rebuilding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard unsecured cards:</strong> for established profiles with acceptable scores and income.</li>
        <li><strong>Secured cards:</strong> deposit-backed limits that help demonstrate responsible use after problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Builder cards:</strong> low-limit products with simple structures for thin or damaged files.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-branded & rewards cards:</strong> best treated as a second step once fundamentals look stable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whatever you choose, the improvement comes from behaviour, not branding: low utilization, on-time payments
        and avoiding new negatives over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Timeline & expectations -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Realistic Timelines for Improvement</h2>
      <p>
        Score movement is rarely instant. In many systems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Small positive changes can appear within a few reporting cycles.</li>
        <li>Consistent on-time payments and lower utilization can show over 6–12 months.</li>
        <li>Serious issues (defaults, collections, bankruptcies) can take years to fade in impact.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There is no legitimate “quick fix” for major derogatory events. What you can control is the pattern from now on.
