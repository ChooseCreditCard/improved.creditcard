          “Improving” your credit-card setup rarely means chasing more complexity. It usually means better structure: the right mix of cards, clearer fee awareness, and consistent habits that support your financial goals.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does an “Improved” Card Setup Look Like?</h2>
      <p>An improved credit-card setup fits your actual life: income, spending pattern, travel frequency and attitude to risk. The cards you hold should work together, not pull you in different directions with overlapping fees or redundant perks.</p>
      <p>This page focuses on the levers you can control — card selection, usage patterns and simple routines — instead of chasing one-off offers or marketing headlines.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Levers -->
    <section id="levers" class="section">
      <h2>Key Levers You Can Adjust</h2>
      <p>Most improvements come from a small set of decisions and habits. You don’t need dozens of cards to get more value; you need a clearer structure and defined roles for each product.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Card roles:</strong> Decide which card is for everyday spend, which is for travel, and which, if any, is kept purely for backup.</li>
        <li><strong>Fee awareness:</strong> Track annual fees, FX fees and interest so you know exactly what each card costs you to keep.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit management:</strong> Match credit limits to your comfort level and expected spend instead of maximising borrowing potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Reward alignment:</strong> Use cards whose reward structures match how you actually spend, not how you wish you spent.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk controls:</strong> Enable alerts, strong authentication and sensible transaction limits for day-to-day safety.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Behaviour -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Behaviour Changes That Make the Biggest Difference</h2>
      <p>Card choice matters, but behaviour usually dominates outcomes. Small, repeatable habits have more impact than occasional optimisations.</p>
      <p>Examples include paying statements in full and on time, avoiding cash advances, reviewing transactions regularly and keeping a buffer below your credit limit so utilisation stays comfortable.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Clean-Up & Consolidation -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When It Makes Sense to Simplify</h2>
      <p>Improvement can also mean owning fewer cards. If you have multiple products with overlapping benefits, high fees or little use, consolidating into a smaller, clearer set can reduce friction and cognitive load.</p>
      <p>Closing accounts can affect your overall history and utilisation, so it is important to understand the trade-offs before you streamline your wallet.</p>
